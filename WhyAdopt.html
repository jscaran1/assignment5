    <h2>The Sad Truth Behind that Puppy in the Window</h2>

        <h3>Puppy Mills</h3>
        <p>Many puppies that are sold in pet shops come from places called Puppy Mills. A Puppy Mill is an establishment that breeds puppies for sale, typically done on an intensive basis and in conditions regarded as inhumane. Many puppies that come from these mills end up having health conditions, due to lack of care and incest. Even worse, the mothers of these puppies are overbread and not given time to heal in between breeings. They are also often tortured and killed when they become unable to breed, as if they are completely useless and do not desrve life. Most puppies that are sold in pet shops come from these awful places. Please adopt, and do not shop for puppies. There are thousands of dogs that are put down in shelters everyday, when you could be their forever home.</p>
